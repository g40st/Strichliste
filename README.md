# Web-based tally list (docker)

This is a web-based tally list to track the drinks of some users. You can specify the users in the source code.

ATTENTION: There are no security measures implemented like session handling. You can reengineer the communication protocol to access all functions. Therefore do not use this web-based tally list on a public network.

## Nice To Know

### Database
There will be a kind of database stored on your local filesystem. The database will be stored on your local user directory. The file is named "StrichlisteDB.txt".

### Users
Adopt the array size and the array elements. After that run ant and you will get your users.

```java
    private static final User[] users = new User[4];

    private Singleton() {
        users[0] = new User("user1");
        users[1] = new User("user2");
        users[2] = new User("user3");
        users[3] = new User("user4");
 ```
